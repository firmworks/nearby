# Geo encoding Providers and configuration


## Google API Key provider

Using a google API key is recommended to give your users the optimum experience for searching from arbitrary addresses, postal codes, cities and more.
The base provider requires a full non typoed address to get results - google provides a more "fuzzy" matching experience.

Google provides (as of 1/1/2023) 200 dollars per month credit to a google cloud account. This entails that your organization can use up to 20,000 api calls a month and not be charged.
